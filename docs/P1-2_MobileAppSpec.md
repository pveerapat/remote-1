# ARI V1 — P1-2 Mobile App Implementation Specification v1.0

## 1. Document Control

Project: ARI — Agricultural Intelligence Platform

Document Title: ARI V1 — P1-2 Mobile App Implementation Specification v1.0

Version: v1.0

Status: Draft Revised with Section 36 / Ready for Owner Review

Freeze Readiness: Not Yet — Backend/API Revision Required Before Freeze

Scope: Flutter Mobile App Implementation Specification

Target Platforms:

```text
Android
iOS
```

This document defines how to implement the ARI mobile app using Flutter.

This document does not redesign:

```text
ARI Architecture
Backend Architecture
Database Architecture
Core Domain Model
RBAC Role List
Mobile UX Principles
Web App Scope
Desktop App Scope
```

### 1.1 Source of Truth

This document follows the frozen ARI documents:

```text
#44 Farm AI Operating System
#45 Software Architecture & Monorepo Specification Rev2.0
#46 MVP Software Build Plan
#46A Mobile App UX Flow & Screen Specification
#46B Web App UX Flow & Screen Specification
#47 AI Agent Development Workflow Framework
ARI V1 — P0 Domain Model Specification v1.0
ARI V1 — P0 Database Schema Specification v1.0
ARI V1 — P0 API Specification v1.0
ARI V1 — P1-1 Backend Implementation Specification v1.0
```

### 1.2 Frozen Baseline Dependencies

The following frozen baseline decisions remain unchanged:

```text
One Platform
One Backend
One Database Architecture
One Mobile App
One Web App
One Domain Model
One RBAC System

organization_id required
farm_id nullable
zone_id nullable
tree_id nullable

Notebook Entry = Note Session
Note Item = Timeline Item
Consultation = Notebook Entry Type
QR = Representation, not Entity
RBAC = Backend Dependency Guards
No Permission Service
Save Local ≠ Upload ≠ Analyze
Offline First
Capture First
Structure Later
```

### 1.3 Owner-Approved Revision Requirements

The following decisions were added during P1-2 review and must be treated as formal revision requirements to P0 API / P1-1 Backend before coding:

```text
Mobile self-registration
Phone-number login
farmer_status:
  - owner
  - owner_family
  - farm_staff
membership_status:
  - pending_farm_approval
  - active
  - rejected
  - suspended
  - revoked
Owner registration creates or assigns organization_id
Owner may create multiple farms
Owner's Family / Farm Staff join by Farm ID, not Owner ID
First-time permission setup after registration/login
Create Farm location auto-fill from phone GPS
Android/iOS only in P1-2
Web App moved to P1-3
Desktop App out of scope
```

These revision requirements must not create a separate platform, separate app, new RBAC role, permission service, owner registry, QR registry, or consultation entity.

---

## 2. Implementation Boundary

### 2.1 P1-2 Required

P1-2 covers:

```text
Flutter project structure
Android/iOS mobile app implementation
Mobile registration and login flow
Phone-number login
Farmer status selection
Owner onboarding
Farm join policy
Farm creation
Zone and Tree creation if allowed
First-time permission setup
Authentication state
RBAC visibility
Offline local storage
Offline capture
Upload queue
Offline sync
File upload via backend presigned URL
Media capture
Ask AI external consultation workflow
Farm Notebook
Notifications
Follow-ups
QR scan as representation only
Error handling
Security handling
Configuration
Testing
Android/iOS build and release
```

### 2.2 P1-2 Optional Extension

Optional extensions may be added only if they do not require architecture redesign or new core entities:

```text
QR scan helper UI
QR display from existing Farm / Zone / Tree ID
Share-to-ARI from external apps
Media thumbnail preview
Wi-Fi-only upload option
Local-only draft export
Basic upload progress notification
```

### 2.3 Future Enhancement

The following are not part of P1-2:

```text
Internal AI Assistant
Knowledge Graph
Vector Database
RAG
Agent Orchestration
Commerce
Robot Control
Irrigation Control
Fertilizer Control
Audit System
Fine-grained Permission Service
Semantic Search
LLM Search
Advanced AI Media Processing
OTP / SMS verification
Invite link
Password reset
Forced password change
Owner-managed member approval screen
Multi-farm membership table
macOS Desktop App
Ubuntu Desktop App
Windows Desktop App

```

### 2.4 Non-Goals

P1-2 must not introduce:

```text
New mobile UX redesign
Separate Farmer App
Separate Staff App
New backend service
New database architecture
New domain model
New RBAC role
Permission service
Permission matrix engine
QR Registry
Consultation Entity
Owner Registry
Block Registry
Knowledge Module
Robot Module

```

---

## 3. Mobile App Principle

ARI Mobile must preserve:

```text
One Mobile App
No Separate Farmer App
No Separate ARI Staff App
Role-Based Access Control
Offline First
Capture First
Simple Home Screen
Evidence First
Human-in-the-Loop
Progressive Adoption
Structure Later
```

The user should think only:

```text
Ask
Record
Review
Learn
```

### 3.1 Save Local Principle

Mobile must always preserve:

```text
Save Local
≠
Upload
≠
Analyze
```

Meaning:

```text
Capture can happen offline.
Local save must happen before upload.
Upload can happen later.
Analysis is not required for local capture.
```

---

## 4. Technology Stack

### 4.1 Mobile Framework

```text
Flutter
```

### 4.2 Target Platforms

```text
Android
iOS
```

### 4.3 Out of Scope Platforms

```text
macOS Desktop App
Ubuntu Desktop App
Windows Desktop App
Web App
```

Notebook / PC / desktop browser access will be handled later in:

```text
P1-3 Web App Implementation Specification
```

### 4.4 Backend API

```text
FastAPI REST API
/api/v1
```

### 4.5 Authentication

```text
JWT Access Token
Refresh Token
Phone-number login
```

### 4.6 Local Storage

```text

POST /api/v1/files/complete
```

### 4.9 Sync

```text
client_id
device_id
client_batch_id
POST /api/v1/sync/batch
upload_queue
```

## 6. App Architecture

Use simple layered Flutter architecture:

```text
Presentation Layer
State Management Layer
Application / Service Layer
Repository Layer
Local Storage Layer
Remote API Layer
```

### 6.1 Presentation Layer

Responsible for:

```text
Screens
Widgets
Forms
Navigation
User interaction
Local validation messages
Upload/sync state display
Permission explanation
Offline status display
```

Must not:

```text
Call REST APIs directly
Write directly to local database
Act as permission authority
Implement backend business rules
```

### 6.2 State Management Layer

Recommended approach:

```text
ChangeNotifier-based providers
```

Track:

```text
Authentication state
Registration state
Farmer status state
Active farm context
Offline queue state
Upload queue state
Notebook draft state
Notification state
Follow-up state
Permission state
```

### 6.3 Application / Service Layer

Responsible for:

```text
Registration flow orchestration
Login flow orchestration
Permission setup orchestration
Farm setup flow
Draft save flow
Capture flow
Sync flow
Upload flow
Follow-up scheduling
Notification scheduling
External AI handoff flow
```

### 6.4 Repository Layer

Responsible for:

```text
Read/write local records
Call remote API client
Map local model to API DTO
Map API response to local model
Maintain server_id mapping
```

### 6.5 Local Storage Layer

Responsible for:

```text
Draft notebook entries
Draft note items
Local media paths
Upload queue
Sync queue
Device ID
Client IDs
Active farm context
Cached farm/zone/tree lists
Cached user/session data
Notification cache
Follow-up cache
```

### 6.6 Remote API Layer

Responsible for calling frozen or revised `/api/v1` APIs.

No feature may require a separate backend.

---

## 7. Account Registration and Phone Login

### 7.1 Revision Requirement

This section is an Owner-approved revision requirement.

Frozen P0 API originally defined login by email/password and admin/root user creation.

P1-2 requires:

```text
Mobile self-registration
Phone number as platform-wide login ID
Password login
JWT token response
Offline use after first successful login
```

Backend/API must support this before coding.

### 7.2 Login ID Rule

The mobile phone number is the platform-wide login ID.

```text
login_id = phone number
```

The same phone number should be usable for:

```text
Android App
iOS App
Future Web App in P1-3
```

### 7.3 Phone Normalization

Mobile must normalize phone number before submitting.

Acceptable format must be fixed by backend/API.

Recommended display examples:

```text
0812345678
+66812345678
```

Rules:

```text
Phone number must be unique.
Phone number must be validated by backend.
Mobile must use same phone format for registration and login.
```

### 7.4 Registration Screen

Purpose:

```text
Allow new users to register from mobile app.
```

Required fields:

```text
Phone number
Name
Password
Farmer status
```

Farmer status must be single choice, not checkbox:

```text
( ) Owner / เจ้าของสวน
( ) Owner's Family / คนในครอบครัวเจ้าของสวน
( ) Farm Staff / คนงานหรือพนักงานสวน
```

If status is `owner_family` or `farm_staff`, require:

```text
Farm ID
```

Optional fields:

```text
Relationship note
Known owner name
Additional note
```

### 7.5 Default Password Policy

For P0 pilot simplicity, default password may be:

```text
1234
```

Rules:

```text
Default password is allowed only for P0 pilot.
Backend must store only password_hash.
Mobile must not store password in plain local database.
Mobile must not log password.
Production should replace this with OTP, invite link, or stronger password policy.
```

Recommended but not required for P1-2:

```text
After first successful login, app should encourage user to change password.
```

### 7.6 Registration API Requirement

Required API revision:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/register
```

Required request fields:

```text
phone
name
password
farmer_status
farm_id if farmer_status = owner_family or farm_staff
```

Expected backend behavior:

```text
Create user_id
Validate phone uniqueness
Assign role = farmer
Store password_hash
Assign status / membership_status based on farmer_status
Return authentication result or require login
```

This must not create:

```text
member_registry
farmer_registry
owner_registry
separate farmer account table
separate authentication service
```

---

## 8. Farmer Status Policy

### 8.1 Role vs Status

Do not create new RBAC roles.

Use existing role:

```text
role = farmer
```

Add farmer status:

```text
farmer_status = owner
farmer_status = owner_family
farmer_status = farm_staff
```

### 8.2 Backend/API Revision Required

`farmer_status` must be persisted by backend.

Recommended minimal additive backend change:

```text
users.farmer_status nullable
```

or equivalent approved storage in the existing user/profile model.

This must be processed as formal DB/API revision before coding.

### 8.3 Owner

Owner means:

```text
Actual farm owner or primary responsible person.
```

Owner can:

```text
Register by phone number
Receive or create organization_id
Create multiple farms under own organization
Create zones under own farms
Create trees under own zones if desired
Create notebook entries
Use Ask AI
View own farm notebook
```

Owner cannot:

```text
Access other organizations
Create admin/root/ari_staff users
Bypass backend authorization
```

### 8.4 Owner's Family

Owner's Family means:

```text
Family member of farm owner.
```

Must register with:

```text
Farm ID
```

Can:

```text
Register by phone number
Request to join farm
Create notebook entries after approval
Use Ask AI after approval if allowed
View farm data within approved scope
```

Cannot:

```text
Create Farm ID
Create Zone ID
Create Tree ID
Manage users
Change owner
Access unapproved farms
```

### 8.5 Farm Staff

Farm Staff means:

```text
Worker or staff member working at a farm.
```

Must register with:

```text
Farm ID
```

Can:

```text
Register by phone number
Request to join farm
Create notebook entries after approval
Capture photo/video/voice/text/file/link after approval
Use Ask AI if allowed
```

Cannot:

```text
Create Organization
Create Farm ID
Create Zone ID
Create Tree ID
Manage users
Change owner
Access unapproved farms
```

---

## 9. Owner Registration and Organization Assignment

### 9.1 Owner Registration Flow

```text
User installs app
↓
Tap Register
↓
Enter phone number
↓
Enter name
↓
Enter password
↓
Select farmer_status = owner
↓
Submit while internet is available
↓
Backend creates user_id
↓
Backend creates or assigns organization_id
↓
Backend returns registration result
↓
Mobile stores authenticated session
↓
Mobile opens Permission Setup
↓
Mobile opens Create Farm flow
```

### 9.2 Organization Rule

Because `organization_id` is required for ARI records, backend should create or assign `organization_id` immediately after owner registration.

Recommended policy:

```text
Owner registration creates/assigns organization_id immediately.
Account may be marked active_pending_verification or pending_review.
Admin can suspend/revoke later if registration is false.
```

Avoid:

```text
Owner waits without organization_id
```

because without `organization_id`, mobile cannot create properly scoped records.

### 9.3 Owner Verification / False Registration

If a user falsely registers as owner:

```text
Admin can suspend, reject, revoke, or deactivate the account.
Backend controls account status.
Mobile only displays resulting status.
```

Allowed statuses:

```text
active
pending_review
suspended
rejected
revoked
```

P1-2 mobile must display meaningful messages for suspended/rejected/revoked accounts.

---

## 10. Farm Join Policy for Owner's Family and Farm Staff

### 10.1 Join Reference

Owner's Family and Farm Staff must join by:

```text
Farm ID
```

not:

```text
Owner ID
```

Reason:

```text
One owner may have multiple farms.
Owner ID alone does not identify which farm the member belongs to.
Farm ID identifies the exact farm.
```

### 10.2 Family / Staff Registration Flow

```text
User installs app
↓
Tap Register
↓
Enter phone number
↓
Enter name
↓
Enter password
↓
Select farmer_status = owner_family or farm_staff
↓
Enter Farm ID
↓
Submit while internet is available
↓
Backend validates Farm ID exists
↓
Backend creates user_id
↓
Backend links request to Farm ID
↓
membership_status = pending_farm_approval
↓
Mobile shows pending approval message
```

### 10.3 Pending Approval Message

English:

```text
Your request has been sent.
Waiting for farm owner or admin approval.
```

Thai:

```text
ส่งคำขอเข้าร่วมสวนแล้ว
กรุณารอเจ้าของสวนหรือผู้ดูแลระบบอนุมัติ
```

### 10.4 Membership Status

Backend/API revision should support:

```text
pending_farm_approval
active
rejected
suspended
revoked
```

### 10.5 Minimal P1-2 Membership Storage

Recommended minimal P1-2 backend revision:

```text
users.primary_farm_id nullable
users.membership_status nullable
```

Used for:

```text
owner_family
farm_staff
```

This avoids adding a `farm_memberships` table in P1-2.

### 10.6 Future Membership Enhancement

Future enhancement:

```text
farm_memberships table
multi-farm membership
owner-managed member approval screen
invite code
member permission settings
```

These are not part of P1-2.

### 10.7 Approval Responsibility

P1-2 minimal policy:

```text
Admin / ARI Staff handles approval through backend/admin workflow.
Owner self-approval screen is Future Enhancement unless separately approved.
```

Mobile must not implement a full member-management system in P1-2.

---

## 11. Authentication Implementation

### 11.1 Login

API:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/login
```

Revision requirement:

```text
Login accepts phone number + password.
```

Mobile flow:

```text
User enters phone number
↓
User enters password
↓
Mobile calls backend login
↓
Backend verifies phone and password_hash
↓
Backend returns access_token + refresh_token
↓
Mobile stores tokens securely
↓
Mobile calls /api/v1/auth/me
↓
Mobile restores user, role, farmer_status, organization_id, membership_status
↓
Navigate to next required screen
```

### 11.2 First Login Requirement

First registration and first login require internet.

If no internet and no prior session exists:

```text
No internet. Please connect to the internet for first login.
```

### 11.3 Offline Use After First Login

After successful first login, ARI Mobile must support offline use.

Allowed offline actions:

```text
Open Home Screen
View cached Farm Notebook
Create Add Note drafts
Capture photo
Capture video
Record voice
Write text note
Attach file
Add link
Use existing media
Create local Notebook Entry
Create local Note Items
View pending upload queue
View cached notifications
Capture follow-up outcome locally
Use cached farm/zone/tree context
```

Actions requiring internet must show:

```text
No internet
```

Examples:

```text
First registration
First login
Token refresh
Backend sync
Media upload to MinIO
Fresh farm/zone/tree loading
Fresh notifications loading
ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude usage
Backend confirmation
```

### 11.4 Token Storage

Store securely:

```text
access_token
refresh_token
```

Never store:

```text
plain password
token in logs
token in plain local database
```

### 11.5 Access Token Handling

Every authenticated API request must include:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### 11.6 Refresh Token Handling

API:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

Flow:

```text
401 token_expired
↓
Call refresh endpoint
↓
If success, retry once
↓
If failed, require login
```

### 11.7 Logout

API:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
```

Logout behavior:

```text
Clear tokens
Clear session state
Stop upload worker
Keep unsynced drafts/media unless user confirms deletion
```

After logout:

```text
Offline use is not allowed until user logs in again online.
```

---

## 12. RBAC in Mobile

Frozen roles:

```text
farmer
ari_staff
farm_coordinator
agronomist
reviewer
admin
root
```

Do not add new roles.

### 12.1 Mobile Responsibility

Mobile controls only:

```text
Visible menu items
Available buttons
Editable fields
Screen entry points
```

### 12.2 Backend Responsibility

Backend remains source of authorization truth.

Mobile must not create:

```text
Permission Service
Permission Matrix Engine
Policy Engine
Authorization Microservice
Permission API
Dedicated permission table
```

### 12.3 Farmer Status Visibility

For `role = farmer`:

```text
farmer_status = owner
  can see Create Farm flow after organization_id exists

farmer_status = owner_family
  must provide Farm ID and wait for approval

farmer_status = farm_staff
  must provide Farm ID and wait for approval
```

### 12.4 Role Visibility Summary

| Role                | Mobile Visibility                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| farmer owner        | Home, Ask AI, Add Note, Farm Notebook, Notifications, Profile, Create Farm/Zone/Tree within own organization |
| farmer owner_family | Home after approval, Add Note, Ask AI, Notebook within approved farm scope                                   |
| farmer farm_staff   | Home after approval, Add Note, Ask AI if allowed, Notebook within approved farm scope                        |
| ari_staff           | Same app, staff field collection and onboarding support if backend allows                                    |
| farm_coordinator    | Farm/Zone/Tree context management in assigned scope                                                          |
| agronomist          | Notebook review and consultation viewing in assigned scope                                                   |
| reviewer            | Notebook filters/status/follow-up review in assigned scope                                                   |
| admin               | Organization/user/farm access in assigned scope                                                              |
| root                | Full system scope                                                                                            |

## 13. Navigation Structure

Navigation must preserve frozen UX.

### 13.1 Home Screen Fixed Primary Actions

```text
🤖 Ask AI
➕ เพิ่มบันทึก
📒 สมุดชาวสวน
🔔 แจ้งเตือน
```

### 13.2 Top-Level Context

Home Screen includes:

```text
🌳 Farm Selector
👤 Profile
```

Settings must be inside Profile or simple Settings area.

### 13.3 Onboarding Navigation

New user path:

```text
Launch App
↓
Register / Login
↓
Permission Setup
↓
If farmer_status = owner:
    Create Farm
↓
If farmer_status = owner_family / farm_staff:
    Pending Farm Approval or Home if active
↓

  "province": "...",
  "district": "...",
  "subdistrict": "...",
  "address": "...",
  "gps_latitude": ...,
  "gps_longitude": ...,
  "source": "device_gps|manual"
}
```

If backend only supports text location, mobile may serialize the location summary into `location` or `description` only if approved.

---

## 17. Local Storage Implementation

Local storage must support:

```text
Draft notebook entries
Draft note items
Media local paths

Registration/onboarding status
Permission setup status
Server ID mapping
```

Secure storage:

```text
access_token
refresh_token
```

Local database:

```text
notebook_entries_local
note_items_local
upload_queue_local
sync_queue_local
follow_ups_local
notifications_local
farm_context_cache
user_session_cache
id_mapping
```

File system storage:

```text
photo files
video files
voice files
picked files
temporary compressed files
```

No data loss after:

```text
app restart
network loss
token expiry
upload failure
partial sync failure
```

---

## 18. Client ID and Device ID Strategy

### 18.1 Device ID

Generate once per installation:

```text
device_id = uuid
```

Persist locally.

### 18.2 Client ID

Generate for every offline-created logical record:

```text
client_id = uuid
```

Applies to:

```text
Notebook Entry
Local Note Item
Follow-Up update
Notification read update
Upload queue item
```

### 18.3 Client Batch ID

Generate for each sync batch:

```text
client_batch_id = uuid
```

Used in:

```text
POST /api/v1/sync/batch
```

### 18.4 Idempotency Rule

Use:

```text
user_id + client_id
```

Rules:

```text
Do not regenerate client_id on retry.
Do not duplicate records after retry.
Map local_id to server_id after success.
```

---

create_follow_up
update_follow_up_outcome
mark_notification_read
```

### 19.2 Sync Batch

API:

```text
POST /api/v1/sync/batch

device_id
organization_id
operations[]
```

Each operation includes:

```text
client_id
operation_type
entity_type
payload
created_at
```

### 19.3 Retry Logic

```text
retry_count starts at 0
max retry from configuration
failed items remain in queue
manual retry allowed
network unavailable blocks retry
```

### 19.4 Partial Success

```text
Mark successful operations synced.
Persist server_id mapping.
Keep failed operations in queue.
Do not resend successful operations.
```

### 19.5 Conflict

```text
Do not delete local record.
Mark conflict.
Show manual review needed.
```

---

## 20. File Upload Implementation

### 20.1 Frozen Upload Endpoints

Use only:

```text
POST /api/v1/files/upload-url
POST /api/v1/files/complete
```

Do not invent:

```text
/files/presign
/files/confirm
/upload/presign
/upload/complete
/media/upload
```

### 20.2 Local Note Item vs Server Note Item

Mobile may create Local Note Item immediately after capture.

Local Note Item may contain:

```text
local_item_id
local_entry_id
client_id
item_type
sequence_order
local_path
file_name
file_size
mime_type
checksum if available
duration_sec if applicable
upload_status
sync_status
```

Server-side media Note Item must be completed only after:

```text
Notebook Entry resolved to server entry_id
Presigned upload URL requested
Media uploaded to MinIO
Backend confirms upload
file_ref / file_path exists
Local Note Item updated with server_item_id and file_ref / file_path
```

### 20.3 Correct Upload Order

```text
Capture media
↓
Create Local Note Item
↓
Save local_path and metadata
↓
Queue upload
↓
Sync or resolve Notebook Entry to server entry_id
↓
Request backend presigned upload URL
↓
Upload media to MinIO
↓
Confirm upload with backend
↓
Create or complete server Note Item with file_ref / file_path
↓
Update Local Note Item mapping
↓
Mark upload_status = completed
```

### 20.4 Failed Upload

```text
Mark upload_status = failed.
Increment retry_count.
Retain local file.
Show retry option.
Do not create duplicate note item.
Reuse same client_id, local_item_id, and sequence_order.
```

---

## 21. Media Capture Implementation

## 36. Cross-Document Revision Impact

### 36.1 Purpose

This section records the cross-document impact of Owner-approved P1-2 decisions that affect frozen backend/API documents.

This section does not create a new ARI document.

This section does not create a new source of truth.

This section is a revision impact note that must be reflected in the relevant frozen documents before P1-2 can be frozen.

### 36.2 Affected Documents

The following documents are affected:

```text
ARI V1 — P0 API Specification v1.0
ARI V1 — P1-1 Backend Implementation Specification v1.0
```

The following documents are not redesigned:

```text
P0 Domain Model
P0 Database Schema
#46A Mobile UX
#46B Web UX
#45 Architecture
#47 AI Agent Development Workflow
```

However, additive changes may be required in the API/backend implementation to support the approved mobile onboarding flow.

### 36.3 Owner-Approved Decisions Causing Revision Impact

The following Owner-approved decisions are now part of P1-2 mobile implementation scope:

```text
1. User can self-register from ARI Mobile App.
2. Registration requires internet.
3. Phone number is the platform-wide login ID.
4. The same login ID should later work for Web App in P1-3.
5. Initial P0 pilot password may be simple, e.g. 1234.
6. Password must never be stored as plain text.
7. First login requires internet.
8. After successful login, mobile can be used offline.
9. Backend/external-AI actions must show “No internet” when offline.
10. Farmer role remains existing role = farmer.
11. farmer_status is added:
    - owner
    - owner_family
    - farm_staff
12. Owner registration creates or assigns organization_id.
13. Owner may create multiple farms under own organization.
14. Owner's Family and Farm Staff join by Farm ID, not Owner ID.
15. Owner's Family and Farm Staff cannot create Farm/Zone/Tree.
16. Owner's Family and Farm Staff require membership approval.
17. membership_status is required:
    - pending_farm_approval
    - active
    - rejected
    - suspended
    - revoked
18. Create Farm screen requires only Farm Name from user.
19. Mobile may auto-fill location from phone GPS.
20. Auto-filled location must be editable before save.
21. First-time Permission Setup is shown after registration/login.
22. P1-2 supports Android and iOS only.
23. Desktop app is out of scope.
24. Web App is moved to P1-3.
```

### 36.4 Required P0 API Revision Impact

The P0 API Specification must be revised or patched to support:

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/register
Phone-number login
Phone normalization
Phone uniqueness
farmer_status
membership_status
Owner registration with organization assignment
Family/Staff registration with Farm ID
Farm ID validation
Create Farm permission for self-registered owner
Structured farm location or approved location storage strategy
```

### 36.5 Required P1-1 Backend Revision Impact

The P1-1 Backend Implementation Specification must be revised or patched to support:

```text
Auth registration service
Phone-based login lookup
Password hash only
User model additive fields
Organization assignment during owner registration
Farm join request handling
membership_status handling
primary_farm_id or approved equivalent
Create Farm authorization for self-registered owner
Farm location storage handling
No new RBAC roles
No permission service
No owner registry
No QR registry
No consultation entity
```

### 36.6 Freeze Rule

P1-2 must not be frozen until one of the following is true:

```text
Option A:
P0 API and P1-1 Backend are revised to include the required changes.

Option B:
Owner explicitly approves P1-2 Freeze with backend/API revision pending,
and the pending items are recorded as required pre-coding blockers.
```

Recommended status before coding:

```text
P1-2 Mobile App Implementation Specification v1.0
Status: Draft Revised
Backend/API Revision Required
Freeze Readiness: Not Yet
```

### 36.7 No Architecture Redesign

The revision impact must not introduce:

```text
New platform
New mobile app
Separate farmer app
Separate staff app
New domain model
New database architecture
New RBAC role
Permission service
Owner registry
QR registry
Consultation entity
Knowledge graph
Vector database
RAG
Agent orchestration
Desktop app
Web app implementation inside P1-2
```

### 36.8 Required Resolution Before Freeze
